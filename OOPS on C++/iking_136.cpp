// ABSTRACT BASE CLASS & PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION
// CLASS HAVING ATLEAST ONE PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION
// AS IN THIS PROBLEM CWH BASE CLASS IS JUST TO GIVE TITLE AND RATINGS TO IT'S DERIVED CLASS AND NOTHING ELSE
// SO THESE TYPES OF CLASSES ARE KNOWN AS ABSTRACT CLASSES
// PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION ARE ONLY JUST TO TELL THE FUNCTION NAME IN THE

// ABSTRACTION IS A WAY OF HIDING ALL UNNECESSARY DETAILS AND SHOWING ONLY THE IMPORTANT PARTS
// ACCESS MODIFIERS (PRIVATE, PUBLIC, PROTECTED) IS A WAY OF DOING ABSTRACTION
// ANOTHER WAY IS ABSTRACT CLASS
// >> ABSTRACT CLASSES ARE USED TO PROVIDE A BASE CLASS FROM WHICH OTHER CLASSES CAN BE DERIVED
// >> THEY CANNOT BE INSTANTIATED AND CAN'T MAKE OBJECTS AND ARE MEANT TO BE INHERITED
// >> ABSTRACT CLASS ARE LIKE A BLUEPRINT OF OTHER CLASSES AND TYPICALLY USED TO DEFINE AN INTERFACE FOR DERIVED CLASS
