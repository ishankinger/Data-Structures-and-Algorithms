    // THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF COPY --> SHALLOW COPY AND DEEP COPY

    // SHALLOW COPY OF AN OBJECT COPIES ALL THE MEMBER VALUES FROM ONE OBJECT TO ANOTHER
    // AS WE ARE MAKING SHALLOW COPY OF OBJECT USING COPY CONSTRUCTOR
    // BUT THERE IS PROBLEM WITH SHALLOW COPY THAT IT DOESNOT WORK FOR DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
    // NORMAL MEMORY ALLOCATES IN STACK MEMORY ( ALL VARIABLES OF FUNCTION WILL BE CREATED IN STACK MEMORY)
    // BUT IF WE ALLOCATE MEMORY USING 'new" KEYWORD, THIS MEMORY IS DYNAMIC MEMORY AND STORED IN A HEAP

    // DRAWBACK OF SHALLOW COPY

    *(s2.cgpaPtr) = 9.2;
    s1.getInfo();             
    // CGPA VALUE OF S1 GET'S CHANGED BECAUSE OF DYNAMIC ALLOCATION
    // SO HERE AS WE ARE DOING SHALLOW COPY
    // ACTUALLY SHALLOW COPY COPIES ALL THE PROPERTIES OF OBJECT SO POINTER'S ADDRESS WILL BE STORED
    // SO BOTH CGPA POINTER WILL BE STORING SAME ADDRESS SO ANY CHANGE IN S2 WILL ALSO AFFECT S1

    // SO HERE COMES THE ROLE OF DEEP COPY WHICH WE HAVE TO WRITE ON OUR OWN AS COMPILER ONLY DO SHALLOW COPY
    // DEEP COPY OF AN OBJECT NOT ONLY COPIES THE MEMBER VALUES BUT ALSO MAKE COPIES OF ANY DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED MEMORY THAT THE MEMBERS POINT TO
